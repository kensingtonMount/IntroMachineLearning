\f0\fs24 \cf0 Project title: Report on CS 4641 Assignment 1: Supervised Learning\
\
This simulation code package is mainly used to reproduce the results of the report.\
\
The author in charge of this simulation code package is: Shuai Nie (email: shuainie@gatech.edu).\
\
Instructions to use this simulation code package:\
\
There are five Matlab .m files, each of which contains the code for implementing five supervised learning algorithms. There are also two .csv files which contain the datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The reference is given in the report. \
\
When running each .m file, the command window will ask for the selection of dataset to run the algorithm. To run the white wine case, simply type 1 and press return/enter; to run the red wine case, type 2 and press return/enter. Then the code will read the corresponding dataset and perform training and testing.\
